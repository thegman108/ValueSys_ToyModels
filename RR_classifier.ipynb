    "Goal: measure how correlated certain features of the policy $\\pi_0$ are to the value $P(URS | \\pi=\\pi_0)$, where $URS$ indicates that the policy was optimized for a random reward function $R \\in U[-1,1]^{|T|}$ (where $|T|$ is the number of transitions with non-zero probability). For simplicity's sake, we assume that it was either optimized for some $R$ or generated uniformly randomly from the set of all policies, with a 50% chance of each scenario. We also assume that the reward is generated i.i.d. via $R(s, a, s') \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n",

    "- On a random deterministic MDP(s), it doesn't seem like URS is identifiable, which is perhaps to be expected as every policy is optimal for some (normalized) reward function\n",
    "    - This also matches our results when looking at the distribution of optimal policies for \"cloud\"-y MDPs\n",
    "- As a control, with MDPs with loops, passing in just the policy (which shouldn't give much information without the related MDP) gives 0.54 accuracy\n",
    "    - Why not 0.50 exactly?\n",
    "    - Similar results with neural network\n",
    "    - This holds true when we use the label predictions for regression (model.predict), as well as the probability prediction (model.predict_proba)\n",
    "- Passing in the policy with the transition function (flattened) gives 0.53 accuracy, even with the NN\n",
    "    - Would likely need a graph neural network to train deep enough \"circuits\" to use the data of the whole transition function effectively\n",
    "- Distance to loop correlates somewhat well with P(URS) (~0.66-0.68 accuracy, 0.61-0.63 log loss on a diverse dataset of sparse transition functions), length of loop not as well (~0.56 accuracy, 0.687 log loss)\n",
    "    - Putting them together doesn't give improvement (~0.67 accuracy, 0.62 log loss)\n",
    "    - Intuitively, the length of the loop an optimal policy takes is its “goal complexity”; distance to loop = “agency” \n",
    "- Setting $k \\in U[1, N/2]$ gives:\n",
    "    - 0.56 accuracy, 0.688 log loss with length of loop; 0.66-0.672 accuracy, 0.61 log loss with distance to loop\n",
    "    - Setting the upper bound of $k$ too high results in some weird MDP package errors, I suspect because sparsity is too high\n",
    "    - This matches the distribution results we found in reward_function.ipynb, as sparsity didn't seem to \"matter\" until around ~0.9 given (S, A) = (10, 4)\n",
    "- $k \\in U[1, N]$ gives similar results\n",
    "    - (Note that this was run with PolicyIterationModified instead of ValueIteration with the same settings, which I don't expect to change any of the results, but I might be wrong)\n",
    "- Calculating whether the policy enters a self loop or not for each state $s$ gives 0.8 accuracy, 0.43 log loss!\n",
    "    - With policy and distance to loop included, ~0.82-0.84 accuracy, 0.38-0.40 log loss\n",
    "    - Similar results with neural network\n",
    "    - Surprisingly, the logistic coefficients are all negative, meaning that a policy that takes more self-loops is *less* likely to be sampled via URS or USS\n",
    "        - 0.9999 chance of being from UPS if the policy always takes self-loops; 0.95 chance of being from URS/USS if it never takes self-loops\n",
