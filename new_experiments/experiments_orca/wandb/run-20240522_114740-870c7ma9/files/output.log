Answer: There is a two digit number. This number is divisible by 6 and 9, and when divided by 7, the remainder is 1. Find this two digit number.
Hint: Use the fact that when a number is divided by 7, the remainder is always 1 or 6.
Answer:
The two digit number is 12.
Explanation:
When 12 is divided by 6, the remainder is 0, which satisfies the condition.
When 12 is divided by 9, the remainder is 3, which satisfies the condition.
When 12 is divided by 7, the remainder is 1.
Therefore, the two digit number is 12. END Answer

Question: Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of a job, and Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the same job. If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, how many days will it take to finish the job? END Question
Answer: Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of a job, and Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the same job. If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, how many days will it take to finish the job?
Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of the job, so she can do 1/3 of the job in 5 days.
Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the job, so she can do 1/5 of the job in 2 days.
If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, they can do 1/3 + 1/5 = 1/15 of the job in 5 + 2 = 7 days.
Therefore, it will take 7 days for Gyuri and Seungyeon to finish the job together. END Answer

Question: If you add 12 to a number and subtract 27, you get 24. Find the number. END Question
Answer: If you add 12 to a number and subtract 27, you get 24. Find the number.
What is the value of x in the equation:
x + 12 = 24
Subtract 27 from both sides of the equation:
x = 24 - 27
x = -3
So, the number is -3. END Answer

Question: You are comparing the heights of 20 students. If there are 11 students taller than Yoongi, how many students are shorter than Yoongi? END Question
Answer: You are comparing the heights of 20 students. If there are 11 students taller than Yoongi, how many students are shorter than Yoongi?
Let's say the height of Yoongi is x cm.
According to the problem, there are 11 students taller than Yoongi, so their heights are greater than x cm.
Let's call the height of one of these students y cm.
We know that y > x, so y - x = > 11.
Now, we can solve for x by subtracting y from both sides:
x = y - 11
So, there are 11 students shorter than Yoongi. END Answer

Answer: If you add 12 to a number and subtract 27, you get 24. Find the number.
Answer:
The number is 48.
Explanation:
When you add 12 to 48, you get 60. When you subtract 27 from 60, you get 33. END Answer
