Question being sent There is a two digit number. This number is divisible by 6 and 9, and when divided by 7, the remainder is 1. Find this two digit number.
Question: There is a two digit number. This number is divisible by 6 and 9, and when divided by 7, the remainder is 1. Find this two digit number. END Question
Answer: There is a two digit number. This number is divisible by 6 and 9, and when divided by 7, the remainder is 1. Find this two digit number.
Hint: Think about the number line and how the digits relate to each other.
Answer:
The two digit number is 39.
Explanation:
When divided by 6, the number 39 leaves a remainder of 0, which means it is divisible by 6.
When divided by 9, the number 39 leaves a remainder of 1, which means it is divisible by 9.
When divided by 7, the number 39 leaves a remainder of 1, which means it satisfies the condition given in the problem. END Answer
Question: Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of a job, and Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the same job. If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, how many days will it take to finish the job? END Question
Answer: Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of a job, and Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the same job. If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, how many days will it take to finish the job?
Gyuri works at a rate of 1/3 of the job in 5 days, so Gyuri's rate is 1/3.
Seungyeon works at a rate of 1/5 of the job in 2 days, so Seungyeon's rate is 1/5.
When Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:
1/3 + 1/5 = 7/15
So, it will take 7/15 of the time it would take one person to finish the job alone to finish the job with both Gyuri and Seungyeon working together. END Answer

Question: There are 2 number cards. One has 15 written on it, and the other has the value of number on the first card multiplied by 0.9. Find the area of the rectangle whose length and width are the same numbers on these two cards. END Question
Answer: There are 2 number cards. One has 15 written on it, and the other has the value of number on the first card multiplied by 0.9. Find the area of the rectangle whose length and width are the same numbers on these two cards.
The two cards are:
Card 1: 15
Card 2: 15 x 0.9 = 13.5
To find the area of the rectangle, we need to multiply the length by the width. Since the length and width are the same on both cards, we can simply multiply the numbers on the two cards:
Area = 15 x 13.5 = 192.5 square units
Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 192.5 square units. END Answer
