Answer: There is a two digit number. This number is divisible by 6 and 9, and when divided by 7, the remainder is 1. Find this two digit number.
Hint: The number is between 10 and 100.
Answer: The two digit number is 24.
Explanation:
When divided by 6, 24 is divisible: 24 / 6 = 4 with no remainder.
When divided by 9, 24 is divisible: 24 / 9 = 2 with no remainder.
When divided by 7, 24 leaves a remainder of 1: 24 / 7 = 3 remainder 1. END Answer
Question: Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of a job, and Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the same job. If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, how many days will it take to finish the job? END Question
Answer: Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of a job, and Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the same job. If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, how many days will it take to finish the job?
Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of a job, so Gyuri can do 1/3 of the job in 5 days.
Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the job, so Seungyeon can do 1/5 of the job in 2 days.
If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, they can do 1/3 + 1/5 = 7/15 of the job in 5 + 2 = 7 days.
Therefore, it will take 7 days for Gyuri and Seungyeon to finish the job. END Answer
Question: There are 2 number cards. One has 15 written on it, and the other has the value of number on the first card multiplied by 0.9. Find the area of the rectangle whose length and width are the same numbers on these two cards. END Question
Answer: There are 2 number cards. One has 15 written on it, and the other has the value of number on the first card multiplied by 0.9. Find the area of the rectangle whose length and width are the same numbers on these two cards.

Solution:
Let's call the length of the rectangle $x$. Since the width of the rectangle is the same as the length, we can write $x = w$.
From the first card, we have $15x = 15w$.
From the second card, we have $0.9 \times 15x = 13.5w$.
Now, we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving them simultaneously, we get:
$x = 12$ and $w = 10$.
So, the area of the rectangle is:
Area = $x \times w = 12 \times 10 = 120$.
Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $120$. END Answer
