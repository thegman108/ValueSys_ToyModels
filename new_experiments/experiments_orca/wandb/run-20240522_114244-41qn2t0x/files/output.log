Answer: There is a two digit number. This number is divisible by 6 and 9, and when divided by 7, the remainder is 1. Find this two digit number.
Hint: Think about the properties of multiples of 6, 9, and 7.
Answer:
The two digit number is 36.
Explanation:
* 36 is divisible by 6 and 9, since 36 / 6 = 6 and 36 / 9 = 4.
* When divided by 7, 36 leaves a remainder of 1, since 36 / 7 = 5 with a remainder of 1.
Therefore, the two digit number is 36. END Answer
Question: Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of a job, and Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the same job. If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, how many days will it take to finish the job? END Question
Answer: Gyuri takes 5 days to do 1/3 of a job, and Seungyeon takes 2 days to do 1/5 of the same job. If Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, how many days will it take to finish the job?
Gyuri works at a rate of 1/3 of the job in 5 days, so Gyuri's rate is 1/3 x 5 = 1/5 of the job per day.
Seungyeon works at a rate of 1/5 of the job in 2 days, so Seungyeon's rate is 1/5 x 2 = 1/10 of the job per day.
When Gyuri and Seungyeon work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:
Combined rate = Gyuri's rate + Seungyeon's rate
= 1/5 + 1/10
= 7/50
So, it will take Gyuri and Seungyeon 7/50 of the job to finish it, or 7 days. END Answer
Question: There are 2 number cards. One has 15 written on it, and the other has the value of number on the first card multiplied by 0.9. Find the area of the rectangle whose length and width are the same numbers on these two cards. END Question
Answer: There are 2 number cards. One has 15 written on it, and the other has the value of number on the first card multiplied by 0.9. Find the area of the rectangle whose length and width are the same numbers on these two cards.
Answer:
The area of the rectangle can be found using the formula: Area = Length x Width.
In this case, the length of the rectangle is 15, and the width is also 15. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is:
Area = 15 x 15 = 225
So, the area of the rectangle is 225. END Answer

Question: If you add 12 to a number and subtract 27, you get 24. Find the number. END Question
Answer: If you add 12 to a number and subtract 27, you get 24. Find the number.
How to solve:
1. Start with the given equation: 12 + x = 24
2. Subtract 27 from both sides: x = 9
Therefore, the number is 9. END Answer

Question: You are comparing the heights of 20 students. If there are 11 students taller than Yoongi, how many students are shorter than Yoongi? END Question
Answer: You are comparing the heights of 20 students. If there are 11 students taller than Yoongi, how many students are shorter than Yoongi?
Let's say the heights of the 20 students are represented by the numbers 100, 101, 102, ..., 1020.
If there are 11 students taller than Yoongi, that means there are 11 students with heights greater than 1020.
So, the number of students shorter than Yoongi is:
20 - 11 = 9
There are 9 students shorter than Yoongi. END Answer
