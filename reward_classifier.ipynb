We then sparsify the reward function by setting some proportion (e.g. 10%) of the transition values to 0. We then generate the optimal policy for said reward function (using, for instance, policy iteration). We now attempt to build a model that can predict the sparsity used to generate the optimal policy given the transition function, discount rate, and policy itself, but *not* the reward function, as otherwise the problem would be trivial."
