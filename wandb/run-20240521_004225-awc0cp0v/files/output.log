Answer: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day, so 16 - 3 = 13 eggs remain for sale.
Janet bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so 13 - 4 = 9 eggs remain for sale.
Janet sells the eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg, so 9 eggs x $2 = $18 per day.
Therefore, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market. END Answer
Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take? END Question
Answer: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
Answer:
The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount, or 1 bolt, of white fiber. Therefore, it takes a total of 3 bolts of fiber to make the robe (2 blue + 1 white). END Answer
Question: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make? END Question
Answer: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
Answer:
Josh made a profit of $35,000 ($50,000 - $80,000).
Explanation:
To find the profit, we need to subtract the original cost of the house from the increased value of the house after the repairs. In this case, the original cost of the house was $80,000, and the increased value after the repairs was $130,000 ($80,000 x 150%). Therefore, the profit was $35,000 ($130,000 - $80,000). END Answer
