Question being sent Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/generation/utils.py:1510: UserWarning: You are calling .generate() with the `input_ids` being on a device type different than your model's device. `input_ids` is on cuda, whereas the model is on cpu. You may experience unexpected behaviors or slower generation. Please make sure that you have put `input_ids` to the correct device by calling for example input_ids = input_ids.to('cpu') before running `.generate()`.
